# ComposableArch-Example

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the Swift Composable Architecture (TCA) following the comprehensive tutorial provided by Point-Free. TCA is a framework built to manage state in Swift applications in a predictable, understandable, and testable manner. It leverages Swift's powerful features to enable easy composition, modularity, and scalability.

### Features

- **State Management**: Demonstrates managing the state of the application using TCA's state-driven approach.
- **Effects**: Showcases how side effects are handled within the architecture, allowing for actions to be dispatched in response to external events.
- **Reducers**: Utilizes reducers to describe how the state changes in response to actions, encapsulating the business logic of the app.
- **Testing**: Includes tests that demonstrate how to write unit tests for the composable architecture, ensuring that state changes and effects are as expected.

### Learning Outcomes

By going through the tutorial and for this project, you will learn about:

- The core concepts of TCA, including state, actions, effects, and reducers.
- How to structure an app using TCA to improve maintainability and testability.
- Techniques for handling side effects in a controlled manner.
- Best practices for testing TCA applications, ensuring your app behaves correctly under various conditions.
